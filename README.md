> [!NOTE] 
> Hey! Just a quick note: I built this project 4 years ago for a university class using Pascal so this is like a relic of the past, from when I was still taking my baby-steps in programming. There's a lot of obvious errors as the code's a bit on the 'newbish' side. I tried not to change much to leave my initial inexperience intact ðŸ˜›.

# Prisoner Management
 Simple project that will manage prisoners and visitors in a detention center. Written in Pascal.


### Details
This small project will initially be developed in my native language (Portuguese). Then, if time permits, in English.

### Tools used:
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/download.var)

### Why?
This is my first official school project. Despite it emanating a kind of newbie-like feeling, I'm quite proud of it... slight.
