## Prisoner Management
 Simple project that will manage prisoners and visitors in a detention center. Written in Pascal.


#### Details
This small project will initially be developed in my native language (Portuguese). Then, if time permits, in English.

#### Tools used:
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/download.var)

#### Why?
This is my first official school project. Despite it emanating a kind of newbie-like feeling, I'm quite proud of it... slight.

#### Source-code
The source-code will be concentrated on a single file. The essence of the job being small, I didn't (yet) see the necessity of diving it on modules.
